===================================
Because the widget content height is fixed, but the items height is fluid, so sometimes there are some bottom area which is not changed the bg color.
Now, I have set more results for "What's Hot?", "RECENT FORUM POSTS" and "#VERIGAMES TWEETS". In fact, in real online system, there always be more results showing as default.


Please accept this 2 features above.


Thanks.
