1 - For some UI padding or margin, I have make them consistent, please accept.

2 - I have set the font with the updated storyboard which is mentioned in forum.

3 - Please read the forum carefully for the requirements confirmed from copilot.

4 - Please deploy on web server for testing, like XAMPP. Because there is ajax call required.

5 - For game slider, if the "more info" panel is open, the top banner will stop auto slider. Because it will cause the content changing if user reading the details.

Thanks.
